This is my project work from Free Code Camps' Data Analysis Course



## What is Data Analysis
The process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusion and supporting decision-making.



## Stack Learned:
-- Python

## Why Python for Data Analysis?
### Why would we choose Python over R or Julia?
- Very simple and intuitive to learn  
- “correct” language  
- Powerful libraries (not just for Data Analysis)  
- Free and open source  
- Amazing community, docs and conferences  


### When to choose R?
- When R Studio is needed  
- When dealing with advanced statistical methods  
- When extreme performance is needed
