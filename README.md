# Data-Analysis-with-Python---Full-Course-for-Beginners-Numpy-Pandas-Matplotlib-Seaborn-
This is my project work from Free Code Camps' Data Analysis Course



## What is Data Analysis
Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusion and supporting decision-making.


## Stack Learned:
- Python


## Why Python for Data Analysis?
### Why would we choose Python over R or Julia?
- Very simple and intuitive to learn  
- “correct” language  
- Powerful libraries (not just for Data Analysis)  
- Free and open source  
- Amazing community, docs and conferences  


### When to choose R?
- When R Studio is needed  
- When dealing with advanced statistical methods  
- When extreme performance is needed  


## The Data Analysis Process
### 1: Data Extraction
- SQL
- Scrapping
- File Formats
- CSV
- JSON
- XML
- Consulting APIs
- Buying Data
- Distributed Databases

### 2: Data Cleaning
- Missing values and empty data
- Data imputation
- Incorrect types
- Incorrect or invalid values
- Outliers and non relevant data
- Statistical sanitization

### 3: Data Wrangling
- Hierarchical Data
- Handling categorical data
- Reshaping and transforming structures
- Indexing data for quick access
- Merging, combining and joining data

### 4: Analysis
- Exploration
- Building statistical models
- Visualization and representations
- Correlation vs Causation analysis
- Hypothesis testing
- Statistical analysis
- Reporting

### 5: Action
- Building Machine Learning Models
- Feature Engineering
- Moving ML into production
- Building ETL pipelines
- Live dashboard and reporting
- Decision making and real-life tests
